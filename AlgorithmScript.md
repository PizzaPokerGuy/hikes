Slide 1:
What is an Algorithm?
Type this into Google and it will tell you it is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

Slide 2: 
Real life Algorithms
An algorithm is really just a set of steps to accomplish something that is correct and efficient.  We use algorithms in our daily lives all the time. For example, if you’re hungry and want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich there are a series of steps to do this. Get the materials out, spread the jelly, spread the peanut butter, push the pieces together, slice in half and eat it. 

Slide 3:
What does that mean for programming?
An algorithm in programming is a set of steps to accomplish a task and Free Code Camp has a ton of great examples of algorithms. Let’s take a look at the Reverse a String algorithm,
One way to solve it is:
Step 1: split the string up on each letter
Step 2: call the reverse array method which will reverse the values in the array
Step 3: join the array values back together into a string
This is a simple algorithm for how to reverse a string.
At the end of the day an algorithm is nothing more than a set of steps to accomplish a goal and then end.
